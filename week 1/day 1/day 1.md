#What is HTML?
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 as a standard for creating web pages. It's a markup language used to structure content on the web, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images. HTML forms the backbone of web content. In layman's terms, HTML is like the skeleton of a website. It's a set of instructions that tells a web browser how to display text, images, videos, and other elements on a webpage. Think of it as the building blocks that create the structure and look of a website, similar to how bricks and mortar are used to build a house.

In a nutshell:

HTML is the language of the web, used to create websites.
HTML defines the barebone structure or layout of web pages that we see on the Internet.
HTML consists of a set of tags contained within an HTML document, and the associated files typically have either a .html or .htm extension.
There are several versions of HTML, with HTML5 being the most recent version.
Features of HTML
It is platform-independent. For example, Chrome displays the same pages identically across different operating systems such as Mac, Linux, and Windows.
Images, videos, and audio can be added to a web page (For example - YouTube shows videos on their website).
HTML is a markup language and not a programming language.
It can be integrated with other languages like CSS, JavaScript, etc. to show interactive (or dynamic) web pages.

Boilerplate code
<!DOCTYPE html>   
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Body -->
</body>
</html>
Summary:-
The <!DOCTYPE html> tag specifies that the document is an HTML5 document.
The <html lang="en"> tag defines the document to be in English.
The <head> section contains metadata and the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser's title bar.
The <body> section contains the content that will be displayed on the webpage.
The h1 and p are two types of tags. We will learn about more tags in the later section.
